**RATransformers**, short for Relation-Aware Transformers, is a package built on top of [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
that enables the training/fine-tuning of multiple models with some extra relation-aware weights. 
These extra weights enable the model to **encode explicit relations between different parts of the input data**.
