**RATransformers**, short for Relation-Aware Transformers, is a package built on top of [transformers ü§ó](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
that enables the training/fine-tuning of models with extra relation-aware input features.

### Example - Encoding a table in TableQA (Question Answering on Tabular Data)

[[Notebook Link](https://github.com/JoaoLages/RATransformers/blob/main/notebooks/TableQA_tabfact_example.ipynb)]

In this example we can see that passing the table as text with no additional information to the model is a poor representation.

With RATransformers üê≠ you are to able to encode the table in a more structured way by passing specific relations within the input.
RATransformers üê≠ also allows you to pass further features related with each input word/token.
